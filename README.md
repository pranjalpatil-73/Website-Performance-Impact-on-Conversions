Website Performance Impact on Conversions
Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of website performance (specifically page load times) on user behavior, conversions, and revenue for an e-commerce or SaaS company. The goal is to quantify how much revenue is lost due to slow load times, identify the worst-performing pages, and provide actionable recommendations to improve website performance and increase revenue.

Problem Statement
E-commerce and SaaS companies lose sales if their websites load too slowly. Slow page load times lead to higher bounce rates, lower conversion rates, and ultimately, lost revenue. This project aims to:

Quantify the revenue lost due to slow load times.

Identify the pages causing the most drop-offs.

Provide performance improvement recommendations to increase revenue.

Dataset
A synthetic dataset was generated to mimic real-world website performance data. The dataset includes the following fields:

Page Name: Name of the webpage (e.g., Home, Product Page, Checkout).

Page Load Time: Time taken for the page to load (in seconds).

Bounce Rate: Percentage of users who leave the site without interacting.

Conversion Rate: Percentage of users who complete a desired action (e.g., purchase, sign-up).

Revenue per Conversion: Monetary value of each conversion.

Device Type: Device used by the user (e.g., Mobile, Desktop, Tablet).

Traffic Source: Source of traffic (e.g., Organic Search, Paid Ads, Direct).

Methodology
The project follows a structured data analysis process:

1. Data Generation
A synthetic dataset was created using Python to simulate website performance data. The dataset includes 1,000 records with realistic distributions for page load times, bounce rates, conversion rates, and revenue.

2. Data Preprocessing
Missing values were checked and handled.

New features were added:

Revenue Lost: Calculated as (Bounce Rate * Revenue per Conversion) / 100.

Performance Score: A composite metric combining page load time, bounce rate, and conversion rate.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized the distribution of page load times.

Analyzed the relationship between page load time and bounce/conversion rates.

Identified the worst-performing pages by revenue lost.

4. Business Metrics
Key metrics were calculated to quantify the impact of slow load times:

Total revenue lost.

Revenue lost by page.

Performance by device type.

Performance by traffic source.

5. Insights and Recommendations
   Actionable insights were derived from the analysis, and recommendations were provided to improve website performance and increase revenue.

Business Metrics
The following business metrics were used to measure the impact of website performance:

1. Total Revenue Lost
Definition: Total revenue lost due to slow load times.

Calculation: Sum of Revenue Lost for all records.

Value: $125,000.

2. Revenue Lost by Page
   Definition: Revenue lost for each page due to slow load times.

Calculation: Group by Page Name and sum Revenue Lost.

Example:

Checkout: $50,000

Product Page: $40,000

Home: $20,000

Cart: $10,000

Blog: $5,000

3. Performance by Device Type
Definition: Average performance score by device type.

Calculation: Group by Device Type and calculate the mean Performance Score.

Example:

Desktop: 75
4. Performance by Traffic Source
Definition: Average performance score by traffic source.

Calculation: Group by Traffic Source and calculate the mean Performance Score.

Example:

Organic Search: 80

Direct: 70

Social Media: 60

Paid Ads: 50
Insights
Revenue Loss:

Slow load times are causing a total revenue loss of $125,000.

The Checkout page contributes the most to revenue loss ($50,000).

Worst-Performing Pages:

Checkout: High bounce rate (40%) and slow load time (8 seconds).

Product Page: Moderate bounce rate (30%) and slow load time (6 seconds).

Device Performance:

Mobile users experience the worst performance, with an average load time of 7 seconds and a bounce rate of 35%.

Traffic Source Performance:

Paid Ads have the lowest performance score, with a high bounce rate (30%) and low conversion rate (8%).

Recommendations
Optimize Checkout Page:

Reduce load time to under 3 seconds.

Simplify the checkout process to reduce friction.

Improve Mobile Performance:

Use responsive design and compress images.

Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content.

Enhance Paid Ads Landing Pages:

Ensure landing pages are relevant to the ad content.

Use A/B testing to optimize design and copy.

Implement a CDN:

Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to reduce server response time globally.

Focus on Underperforming Pages:

Prioritize pages with low performance scores (e.g., Checkout, Product Page).

Conduct user testing to identify pain points.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Visualization Tools: Tableau, Power BI (for dashboards)

Dataset: Synthetic dataset generated for this project.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis can be used to quantify the impact of website performance on conversions and revenue. By identifying the worst-performing pages and providing actionable recommendations, companies can significantly improve their website performance, reduce revenue loss, and enhance user experience.
